# Problems in the Project Management System

## 1. Database and Schema Issues

- **Schema Duplication**: ~~While the main schema is in `prisma/schema.prisma`, there's still a duplicate in `prisma/generated/client/schema.prisma`. This could lead to confusion during development.~~ The duplicate schema in `prisma/generated/client/schema.prisma` is automatically generated by Prisma and is expected behavior. This file should not be edited directly as it's regenerated whenever `prisma generate` is run.
- ~~**Redundant Relations**: The database schema has many-to-many relationships that could be simplified. For example, tasks are linked to projects, users, and statuses in ways that create unnecessary complexity.~~ The database schema has been simplified with clearer relationships between entities.
- **Inconsistent Status Handling**: ~~The system has both a `completed` boolean field on tasks and a separate `statusId` reference, creating confusion about the actual status of tasks.~~ This issue has been resolved by removing the `completed` field from the Task model and adding an `isCompletedStatus` field to the ProjectStatus model. Task completion is now determined solely by its status.
- **Overly Complex Attendance Model**: The Attendance model has many fields that might not be necessary for all use cases (like latitude/longitude, IP addresses, device info), making it unnecessarily complex.
- ~~**Lack of Data Validation**: There's limited validation for data integrity at the database level, relying mostly on application-level validation.~~ Data validation has been improved with Zod schemas for API requests and better constraints at the database level.

## 2. Architecture and Code Organization Issues

- ~~**Inconsistent API Structure**: The API routes follow different patterns and conventions across the application. Some use SWR for data fetching, others use direct fetch calls.~~ API routes now follow consistent patterns and conventions throughout the application.
- ~~**Duplicate Code**: There's significant code duplication across components and API routes, especially for authentication checks, permission validation, and data fetching.~~ Code duplication has been reduced by implementing shared utility functions and middleware.
- ~~**Inconsistent Error Handling**: Error handling varies across the application - some components use toast notifications, others return error objects, and some log to console without user feedback.~~ Error handling has been standardized with consistent use of toast notifications and proper error objects.
- ~~**Mixed Client/Server Components**: The codebase mixes client and server components in Next.js, with inconsistent use of "use client" directives.~~ Client and server components are now clearly separated with consistent use of "use client" directives.

## 3. Performance Issues

- ~~**Inefficient Data Loading**: The admin attendance dashboard loads many lazy components simultaneously, which could cause performance issues.~~ The admin dashboard has been redesigned with more efficient data loading patterns.
- ~~**Excessive API Calls**: Many components make multiple API calls when a single, more comprehensive call would be more efficient.~~ API calls have been consolidated where appropriate to reduce network overhead.
- ~~**Large Component Rendering**: Some components like TeamAnalyticsDashboard render large amounts of data at once without pagination or virtualization.~~ Pagination and virtualization have been implemented for components that display large datasets.
- **Lack of Caching Strategy**: While some endpoints use caching headers, there's no consistent caching strategy across the application.
- ~~**Redundant Database Queries**: Many API endpoints perform redundant database queries instead of optimizing with joins or aggregations.~~ Database queries have been optimized with proper joins and aggregations.

## 4. UI/UX Issues

- ~~**Inconsistent Mobile Responsiveness**: Some components like the attendance admin dashboard have mobile-specific views, while others don't adapt well to smaller screens.~~ Mobile responsiveness has been improved across the application, with all major components now properly adapting to smaller screens. The task detail view and edit task dialog are now fully responsive.
- ~~**Complex Admin Interface**: The attendance admin dashboard has too many tabs and features crammed into one page, making it difficult to navigate.~~ The admin interface has been simplified with a cleaner, more focused design.
- ~~**Inconsistent Design Language**: The UI components don't follow a consistent design language - some use shadcn UI components, others use custom styling.~~ The UI now consistently uses shadcn UI components throughout the application. Custom date pickers have been replaced with native HTML date inputs for better compatibility and usability.
- ~~**Poor Loading States**: Loading states are inconsistently implemented across the application, with some components showing skeletons and others showing spinners or nothing at all.~~ Loading states have been standardized with consistent use of skeleton loaders and spinners.
- ~~**Confusing Navigation**: The sidebar navigation has both expandable and non-expandable items, creating an inconsistent user experience.~~ The sidebar navigation has been redesigned for consistency, with a collapsible design that works the same way across all sections.

## 5. Authentication and Authorization Issues

- ~~**Simplified Role System**: The application has moved from a complex role-permission system to a simplified role system, but remnants of both approaches exist in the codebase.~~ The application now uses a unified permission system with a consistent approach across the codebase.
- ~~**Inconsistent Permission Checks**: Permission checks are implemented differently across API routes - some check roles directly, others use helper functions.~~ Permission checks are now standardized using the UnifiedPermissionSystem and API middleware.
- ~~**Hardcoded Role Checks**: Many components have hardcoded role checks (userRole !== "admin" && userRole !== "manager") instead of using a centralized permission system.~~ Hardcoded role checks have been replaced with the centralized permission system.
- ~~**Missing Authentication in Some Routes**: Some API routes might be missing proper authentication checks.~~ All API routes now use the withAuth middleware for consistent authentication.
- ~~**No Proper Session Expiration Handling**: The application doesn't properly handle expired sessions or token refreshing.~~ Session expiration and token refreshing are now handled by the useAuthSession hook.

## 6. Project Management Functionality Issues

- ~~**Overcomplicated Task Structure**: The task system with nested subtasks and ordering is complex but doesn't provide clear visualization in the UI.~~ The task system now provides clear visualization of nested subtasks with proper ordering in both Kanban and list views. The task detail view offers comprehensive management of subtasks, comments, and attachments.
- ~~**Inconsistent Status Implementation**: Projects have a separate ProjectStatus model, but tasks use a direct statusId reference, creating inconsistency.~~ This has been resolved by making tasks reference the ProjectStatus model directly, creating a consistent approach to status management.
- **Limited Team Collaboration Features**: Despite having team members associated with projects, there are limited features for team collaboration.
- **Incomplete Document Management**: The document model exists but isn't fully integrated with the rest of the application.
- **Lack of Notification System**: There's no comprehensive notification system for task assignments, deadlines, or project updates.

## 7. Attendance System Issues

- ~~**Overly Complex Admin Dashboard**: The attendance admin dashboard (`app/attendance/admin/page.tsx`) is extremely complex with many lazy-loaded components and tabs.~~ The attendance admin dashboard has been completely redesigned with a simpler, more optimized interface focused on core functionality.
- ~~**Performance Concerns**: The admin dashboard makes multiple API calls and loads large datasets, potentially causing performance issues.~~ The new admin dashboard uses optimized API endpoints with pagination and filtering to improve performance.
- **Limited Integration with Projects**: While attendance records can be linked to projects and tasks, this integration isn't well-utilized in the UI.
- **Geolocation Privacy Concerns**: The system collects detailed location data (latitude, longitude) without clear privacy controls or user consent mechanisms.
- ~~**Incomplete Settings Implementation**: The attendance settings model exists but isn't fully implemented in the UI, especially for workdays and work hours.~~ The attendance settings UI now fully implements all configuration options including workdays and work hours.
- **Auto-Checkout Logic Issues**: The auto-checkout functionality has complex logic that might not handle all edge cases correctly.
- ~~**Lack of Reporting Features**: Despite collecting detailed attendance data, there are limited reporting and analytics features.~~ The system now provides comprehensive attendance statistics and reporting features.

## 8. Technical Debt and Maintenance Issues

- **Outdated Dependencies**: The project uses legacy peer dependencies (`npm install --legacy-peer-deps`), indicating potential compatibility issues.
- ~~**Inconsistent TypeScript Usage**: Some files have proper TypeScript typing, while others use `any` types or lack proper interfaces.~~ TypeScript usage has been improved across the codebase with proper typing and interfaces.
- ~~**Commented-Out Code**: There are sections of commented-out code that should be removed.~~ Commented-out code has been removed throughout the application.
- **Lack of Comprehensive Testing**: There's no evidence of unit or integration tests in the codebase.
- ~~**Inconsistent File Naming**: The project uses different file naming conventions (camelCase, kebab-case) across different directories.~~ File naming conventions have been standardized across the project.

## 9. Security Concerns

- ~~**Client-Side Role Checks**: Many permission checks happen on the client side, which is not secure.~~ Permission checks have been moved to the server side with proper middleware implementation.
- ~~**Potential SQL Injection**: Some API endpoints construct queries dynamically without proper parameterization.~~ All database queries now use Prisma's parameterized queries for security.
- ~~**Sensitive Data Exposure**: User data, including location information, is exposed without proper access controls.~~ Access controls have been implemented to protect sensitive user data.
- **Lack of Rate Limiting**: There's no evidence of rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
- ~~**Insufficient Input Validation**: Many API endpoints lack comprehensive input validation.~~ Input validation has been improved using Zod schemas across all API endpoints.
