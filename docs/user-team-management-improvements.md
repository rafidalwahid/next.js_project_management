# User and Team Management System Improvement Plan

This document outlines a prioritized plan for improving the user and team management system in the Project Management application. Issues are listed in order of recommended implementation, with each step building on the previous ones.

## Priority 1: Centralize Permission Checking

**Current Issues:**
- Permission checks are scattered across different files
- Similar permission checking logic is duplicated in multiple places
- Some API endpoints have inconsistent permission checks

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a centralized permission checking middleware
2. Implement decorators or higher-order functions for consistent permission checks
3. Refactor existing API endpoints to use the centralized permission system
4. Add comprehensive tests for permission checks
5. Document the permission requirements for each API endpoint

**Expected Benefits:**
- Reduced code duplication
- Consistent security enforcement
- Easier maintenance and updates to permission logic
- Better documentation of permission requirements

## Priority 2: Consolidate Team Management API Endpoints

**Current Issues:**
- Multiple API endpoints for team management with overlapping functionality
- Inconsistent error handling and response formats
- Potential for confusion about which endpoint to use

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Audit all team-related API endpoints and their functionality
2. Design a consistent API structure for team management
3. Implement consolidated endpoints with consistent error handling
4. Update frontend components to use the new endpoints
5. Add deprecation notices to old endpoints before eventual removal

**Expected Benefits:**
- Cleaner API structure
- Consistent error handling and response formats
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier maintenance and documentation

## Priority 3: Improve User Profile Data Structure

**Current Issues:**
- User profile has many optional fields stored directly in the User model
- Skills are stored as a text field rather than a structured format
- No validation for phone numbers or other structured data

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a separate UserProfile model for extended profile data
2. Implement a UserSkill model for a many-to-many relationship with skills
3. Add proper validation for structured fields like phone numbers
4. Migrate existing user data to the new structure
5. Update UI components to work with the new data structure

**Expected Benefits:**
- Better organization of user data
- Improved search and filtering capabilities
- More consistent data validation
- Separation of authentication data from profile data

## Priority 4: Implement Team Member Invitation Process

**Current Issues:**
- Users are added directly to projects without an invitation process
- No way for users to accept or decline project invitations
- No notification system for team membership changes

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a TeamInvitation model to track pending invitations
2. Implement API endpoints for sending, accepting, and declining invitations
3. Add notification capabilities for invitation events
4. Create UI components for managing invitations
5. Update team management UI to use the invitation system

**Expected Benefits:**
- Better user experience for team collaboration
- Users have control over which projects they join
- Clear tracking of invitation status
- Foundation for a notification system

## Priority 5: Make the Role System Dynamic

**Current Issues:**
- The role system is static with hardcoded roles
- Roles are stored directly in the User model as a string field
- No separate Role model for dynamic role management

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a Role model with name, description, and permissions fields
2. Implement a many-to-many relationship between users and roles
3. Create seed data for existing roles (admin, manager, user, guest)
4. Migrate existing user role data to the new structure
5. Update permission checking to use the new role system
6. Create UI for managing roles and their permissions

**Expected Benefits:**
- Flexibility to create custom roles
- Ability to modify permissions for existing roles
- Better organization of role-related data
- Foundation for more advanced permission features

## Priority 6: Implement Project-Specific Roles

**Current Issues:**
- Team members are added to projects without specific project roles
- The system relies on the user's global role for permission checks
- No way to assign different roles to users within different projects

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add a role field to the TeamMember model for project-specific roles
2. Update permission checking to consider both global and project roles
3. Create UI for managing project-specific roles
4. Implement default role assignment for new team members
5. Update team management UI to display and edit project roles

**Expected Benefits:**
- More granular access control
- Users can have different permissions in different projects
- Project owners have more control over team member permissions
- Better separation of system-wide and project-specific permissions

## Priority 7: Enhance Session Management

**Current Issues:**
- Role changes require re-login to take effect
- No session invalidation when permissions change
- Limited session management capabilities

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Implement session refreshing to update role information
2. Add session invalidation when critical user data changes
3. Create an admin interface for viewing and managing active sessions
4. Implement session timeout and renewal mechanisms
5. Add audit logging for session-related events

**Expected Benefits:**
- Role and permission changes take effect immediately
- Better security through session management
- More control over active sessions
- Improved user experience with session handling

## Priority 8: Implement Soft Delete for Users

**Current Issues:**
- User deletion is permanent with cascade deletion for related records
- No way to recover accidentally deleted users
- References to deleted users in activity logs become invalid

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add soft delete fields to the User model (deleted, deletedAt)
2. Update user queries to filter out soft-deleted users by default
3. Implement restore functionality for soft-deleted users
4. Update UI to indicate soft-deleted status
5. Modify activity logs to handle references to deleted users

**Expected Benefits:**
- Prevention of accidental data loss
- Ability to recover deleted users
- Maintained data integrity in activity logs
- Compliance with data retention policies

## Priority 9: Update UI Components for Permission System

**Current Issues:**
- Some UI components have hardcoded role checks
- Inconsistent handling of user avatars and profile displays
- Limited visual indicators of user permissions

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create reusable permission-aware UI components
2. Update existing components to use the permission system instead of hardcoded role checks
3. Implement consistent user profile display components
4. Add visual indicators for permissions and roles
5. Create a permissions overview page for users

**Expected Benefits:**
- Consistent user experience across the application
- Better support for dynamic roles and permissions
- Improved discoverability of available actions
- Reduced code duplication in UI components

## Priority 10: Implement Advanced Team Analytics

**Current Issues:**
- Limited insights into team composition and activity
- No way to track team performance metrics
- Difficult to identify bottlenecks in team workflows

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a team analytics dashboard
2. Implement metrics for team activity and performance
3. Add visualizations for team composition and skills
4. Create reports for team workload and capacity
5. Implement team comparison features

**Expected Benefits:**
- Better insights into team performance
- Improved resource allocation
- Data-driven team management decisions
- Enhanced reporting capabilities
