- [ ] Create calendar view for events
- [ ] Build analytics and reporting dashboards
- [ ] Implement team management interface
- [ ] Create resource allocation views
- [ ] Add user settings and profile management

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Week 5)

#### Day 1-2: Data Integration
- [ ] Replace localStorage-based state with API calls
- [ ] Implement SWR for data fetching and caching
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Optimize API calls with batching and pagination

#### Day 3-5: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Write unit tests for critical components
- [ ] Implement integration tests for key flows
- [ ] Perform security testing on authentication
- [ ] Optimize database queries and API performance
- [ ] Implement proper error handling throughout the application

### Phase 5: Finalization & Deployment (Week 6)

#### Day 1-3: Final Features & Polish
- [ ] Add notifications system
- [ ] Implement export/import functionality
- [ ] Add dark mode support
- [ ] Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- [ ] Perform accessibility audit and fixes

#### Day 4-5: Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Configure production database
- [ ] Set up deployment pipeline
- [ ] Create documentation
- [ ] Perform final testing

## Migration Strategy (From Template to Working App)

1. **Database Migration**
   - Convert existing data models from the template to Prisma schema
   - Create a script to migrate localStorage data to the database
   - Test data integrity after migration

2. **State Management Update**
   - Refactor DataContext to use API calls instead of localStorage
   - Implement proper loading and error states
   - Add optimistic updates for better UX

3. **Authentication Integration**
   - Replace dummy login/register with NextAuth.js
   - Update protected routes to use session
   - Add role-based access control

## Best Practices to Follow

### Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript strictly with proper type definitions
- Follow ESLint rules for consistent code style
- Write meaningful comments for complex logic
- Use named exports for better code navigation

### API Design
- Use RESTful principles for API endpoints
- Implement proper error responses with status codes
- Version APIs from the beginning (v1)
- Use pagination for list endpoints

### Security
- Store secrets in environment variables
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use CSRF protection
- Implement rate limiting for public endpoints

### Performance
- Use server components where appropriate
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Minimize JS bundle size with code splitting

### Database
- Use database transactions for related operations
- Implement soft deletes for important data
- Use indexes for frequently queried fields
- Follow naming conventions for tables and columns

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Real-time collaboration features with WebSockets
- Advanced file management system
- Integration with third-party services (GitHub, Slack)
- Mobile application development
- AI-powered task suggestions and analytics
- Advanced permission system with custom roles

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the ProjectPro application from the existing template. By following this plan, you'll transform the frontend-only template into a full-stack application with proper data persistence, authentication, and all the modern features expected in a professional project management tool.

The timeline is aggressive but achievable with focused effort. Adjustments may be needed based on specific requirements or challenges encountered during development.
